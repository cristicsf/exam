            <p id="patrix">In terms of headlights, we have implemented the latest technology developed by Audi, Matrix Intelligent Laser Headlights. Matrix Laser technology and its high resolution will make roadway illumination even more flexible and highly versatile – in all situations.The new technology operates with a rapidly moving micro-mirror, which redirects the laser beam. At low vehicle speeds, the light is distributed to a larger projection area, and the road is illuminated with a very wide range. At high speeds, the aperture angle is smaller, and the intensity and range of the light are increased significantly. This is especially advantageous in highway driving. In addition, the light can be distributed precisely. This means that the brightness of different lighting zones can be varied by controlling the illumination dwell times in the specific zones.

            <p id="bat">The Lithium Ion era is over, Fluoride is the new step for humanity.
            Fluoride batteries can have a higher energy density, which means that they may last longer -- up to eight times longer than batteries in use today.
            <br>We developed and create a very compact battery, 2 times smaller than an old lithium-ion car battery but lasting 5 times longer. Resulting an impressive range of 2.350 km in a single charge.

            <p id="panou"> Silicon solar panels have been attached to the roof of the vehicle and can charge while the car is moving. They have been hidden under a thin layer of mattel in order to keep the innovative and discreet style. 30% to 60% of the car’s battery could be charged using the solar technology. With six hours of charge while driving, the vehicle could increase travel distances by 200 kilometers in good conditions of weather.

            <p>
                You have never seen a car interior that screams FUTURE so much. We even have the guts to say that this is the most comfortable car you will see.
The main eye catching thing when you enter in the car are the joysticks.
If the steering is electronic, then there's no particular reason why you need a steering wheel as opposed to any other form of input. A set of joysticks might prove more intuitive.
            They allow for a very relaxed shoulder position as you drive. They don't obscure your dashboard the way a wheel does, leaving room for more information on the displays, and "90 percent of the car's functions" can be controlled through buttons on the joysticks, reducing your need to take your hands off.
